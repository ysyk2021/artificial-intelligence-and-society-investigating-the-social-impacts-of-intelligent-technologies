Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming many aspects of modern society, from healthcare and education to employment and the economy. As these technologies continue to evolve, it is increasingly important to investigate their social impacts and understand how they are shaping human behavior.

The objective of this book is to provide an overview of the social impacts of AI on human behavior and society as a whole. Through a series of chapters, we will explore various aspects of these impacts, such as:
